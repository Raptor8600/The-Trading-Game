            <h3>📘 How the Game Works</h3>
            <p>
                You are a trader.
                Each round, you get one secret card with a number on it (it could be as low as -10 or as high as 20).
                That number represents the value you know.
                Other players (bots) also get cards, but there are a few mystery cards in th emiddle too. You don't get
                to see them.
            </p>
            <p>
                This game was inspired by the real-life <strong>Citibank Trading Game</strong> — a simulation used to
                test aspiring traders.
                The story comes from a young man who used clever strategy and bluffing to beat elite students and win a
                top internship,
                despite starting with fewer resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game uses a special 17-card deck: one -10, one 20, and numbers 1 to 15. You're dealt one card, and
                so are three AI players.
                Three more cards are face down in the middle. The goal? Estimate the total of all 8 cards.
            </p>
            <p>
                You quote a price range ("bid–ask"). If your quote intersects with another player's, you may trade and
                profit. But beware:
                quoting too honestly reveals your card. Bluffing can help — or backfire.
            </p>
            <p>
                Think of it like this: high card = you expect a high total. So you want to buy. Low card? You want to
                sell.
                But quote too precisely and others will know what you have. Smart traders bluff. Smarter ones spot the
                bluff.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Watch what the AI say</strong>. Their narration may hint at deception — or fake it.
                Use math, psychology, and gut instinct. There's even a "💡 Hint" to help explain expected values.
            </p>
            <p>
                Try to find risk-free profit (buy low, sell high) between AI quotes. If you can buy from one AI and sell
                to another —
                that's arbitrage.
